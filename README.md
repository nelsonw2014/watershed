# Watershed

Archival-replay suite designed for AWS Kinesis and S3

###Watershed is a system of tools designed to:
* Launch an EMR Cluster with Apache Drill and Pump
* Configure Apache Drill and Hive to recognize S3 Buckets and Kinesis Streams
* Expose an HTTP REST service which allows someone to query against Drill
* Run SQL Query Results back into a Kinesis Stream

####Watershed includes the Pump REST Service:
* which supports key-value compaction so only the last record for a key is replayed.
* which supports bounded replay (one needn’t replay the full archive).
* which supports filtered replay (only replay records matching some criteria).
* which supports annotating records as they are replayed in order to alter
consumer behavior, such as to force overwrite.
* which, with consumer cooperation, provides some definition of eventual
consistency with respect to records that arrive on a stream concurrently with a
replay operation, without requiring this solution to mediate the flow of the stream.

###Prerequisites
* Python3
* Pip3
* Java 7 (for development of Pump)
